## Penetration-Test-Project

This repository houses a comprehensive Penetration Testing Toolkit designed to assist cybersecurity professionals and enthusiasts in performing thorough security assessments and vulnerability analysis on target networks. The project combines multiple tools and frameworks to perform a systematic approach to penetration testing, covering information gathering, vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and reporting.

# Tools & Frameworks Used
Nmap:
Used for network scanning and enumeration. It identifies open ports, services, and other network configurations on the target, helping in identifying potential attack vectors.

Shodan.io:
Shodan is an Internet of Things (IoT) search engine that helps gather valuable information about exposed services and devices globally. It is used to scout the targetâ€™s public-facing infrastructure and locate potentially vulnerable devices.
This tool aids in footprinting and mapping external assets that may be part of the target environment.

Metasploit Framework:
The Metasploit Framework is employed for exploiting vulnerabilities identified during the reconnaissance phase. It provides a wide range of modules for exploiting known vulnerabilities and gaining access to the target system.
It also assists in post-exploitation activities such as privilege escalation and data extraction.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework:
The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a comprehensive, detailed matrix of known adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
It is used to map and align discovered attack vectors with real-world adversary methods, ensuring more accurate exploitation scenarios and simulating realistic attacks.

# Project Structure
Reconnaissance: Tools for gathering target information, including Nmap scans and Shodan searches.
Exploitation: Metasploit modules for targeting and exploiting vulnerabilities.
Post-Exploitation: MITRE ATT&CK-based analysis for attack progression, lateral movement, and persistence.
